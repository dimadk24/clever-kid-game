These may contain default-value mappings for all tags in the\r\n * oneof but the type tag specifies which one was actually set.\r\n *\r\n * 2) Messages that don't contain a type tag: these are the format required by\r\n * GRPC as inputs. If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\r\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\r\n *\r\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\r\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\r\n *\r\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\r\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\r\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\r\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\r\n * solution.\r\n *\r\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\r\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\r\n * default value for the type.
